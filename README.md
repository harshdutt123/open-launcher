# Notices

If your instance is crashing frequently please make sure you update to the latest version and reset the app data before creating an issue. We made a lot of changes that broke compatibility in the older versions.

Currently there are a lot of issues and we are all working on this app in our spare time so please be patient if your issue is not immediately resolved. We are going to review the structure of the launcher since I wrote this app a long time ago so we might break functionality at times. Thanks for your support.
